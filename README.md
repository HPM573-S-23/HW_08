# Homework Assignment 7


**Note**: Before working on Problems 1-3, review the [solution](https://github.com/HPM573/HW_3_Solution) 
to the [homework assignment 3](https://yale.instructure.com/courses/43583/assignments/92543) to make sure your model is correctly set up. 
You may choose to continue working on the model you created for the the HW assignment 3, 
or on the model provided in the [solution](https://github.com/HPM573/HW_3_Solution).  


**Problem 1: Confidence Interval (Weight 1).**
Print the 95% t-based confidence intervals for the expected reward and the probability of loss. 
You can use 1,000 simulated games to calculate these confidence intervals.

**Problem 2: Interpretation of Confidence Intervals (Weight 1):** 
How do you interpret the confidence intervals you reported in Problem 1?

**Problem 3: Casino Owner versus Gamblers (Weight 3).** Analyze this game from the perspectives of:
1. The casino owner who gets to play this game many times, and
2. A gambler who gets to play this game only 10 times.

Both are interested in knowing their expected reward and the uncertainty in your estimates. 
Report the appropriate interval (confidence or projection) to describe the uncertainty in your 
estimates and interpret these intervals for them.
